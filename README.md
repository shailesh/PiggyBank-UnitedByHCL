Purpose:
Objective: The idea I formulated for a Hackathon UnitedByHCL to bring people to the digital bank which called for Bitcoin. I wrote the idea to create something that is similar to the conventional piggy banks we grew up with. Instead of using real piggy banks, I replaced it with virtual or a physical representation of it. Instead of real money, I used bitcoin. This allows people to learn about and use bitcoin. I mostly used Blockchain's API to utilize most of the funtionality for this project.
most of the funtionality for this project.

Functions:
- Allows creation of wallets
  - Wallets are ways to manage bitcoin that have both a key and pass component. Imagine a regular wallet, but digital and for bitcoin.
- Allows the balance of the wallet to be checked in:
  - Bitcoin
  - USD
- A email/T-Mobile text messaging service to obtain the key/pass for a wallet with a timed delay
- QR code can be generated instantly

Usage:
- Main Window:
  1. Copy a key+password into the entry OR click from the list of keys window.
  2. btc, usd, make, and QR can be used. make can be used at anytime
  3. To use text, enter a email or a T-Mobile number where the pass/key should be sent.
    i. There is a delay of 5 seconds before the system attempts to send the message. In a practical use, the time would
    be longer to match the purpose of a piggy bank.
